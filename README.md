# 🛒 SolarPunk Market
## Cooperative marketplace. No platform cut. No permission required.

> Direct creator-to-buyer. Art, music, writing, code, services.
> You set the price. You keep everything minus payment processing fees.
> The only cut taken is by Visa/Mastercard (2.9% + $0.30) — that's the card network, not us.

## The Problem This Solves

Etsy takes 6.5% + listing fees. Bandcamp takes 15%. Gumroad takes 10%. Amazon takes 15-45%. Every platform extracts value from the moment of exchange between a creator and the person who wants their work.

SolarPunk Market takes 0%.

## How It Works

This is not a platform. It's a frame.

Every seller gets their own GitHub Pages store — free hosting, their own URL, their own payment links wired directly to their own PayPal, Bitcoin address, or Lightning node. SolarPunk Market is the mycelium connecting them: shared templates, shared visibility, shared knowledge about selling without surrendering to a middleman.

List here by opening a GitHub issue with your store link. That's the whole application process.

## Current Sellers

| Store | What | Price |
|-------|------|-------|
| [Gaza Rose Gallery](https://meekotharaccoon-cell.github.io/gaza-rose-gallery) | 56 original AI artworks | $1 each, one free to every visitor |

## The Templates (in `/templates`)

Copy them. Change the name. Deploy. You have a store.

- `seller-page.html` — full store, dark theme, mobile-ready
- `payment-widget.html` — PayPal + Bitcoin + Lightning in one block  
- `listing-card.html` — individual product card
- `cause-bar.html` — optional "X% goes to Y" transparency banner
